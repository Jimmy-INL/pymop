<td>Characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at the centre. The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing algorithms, to be trapped in one of its many local minima.</td>

<td>Griewank</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>Has many widespread local minima, which are regularly distributed. The complexity is shown in the zoomed-in plots.</td>

<td>Rastrigin</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>A&nbsp;non-convex, non-linear multimodal functionused as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of local minima.</td>
